Acute Ischaemic Stroke (AIS) screening tool using haemodynamics waveforms

This study investigates the feasibility of developing a machine-learning model to diagnose and locate occluding blood clots from velocity waveforms, which can be easily be obtained with portable devices such as Doppler Ultrasound. The goal is to
explore this approach as a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to advanced imaging techniques typically available only in large hospitals.

-Research paper that explain details of code will be shared and the code will be improved to make it user-friendly also created database will be shared.
-Database_creator file creates .inp file for healthy and AIS patients. .inp files can execute with Nektar1D[http://haemod.uk/nektar] to simulate 1D blood flow model.
